Hello there, I'm Ashish! I'm a Data Scientist at [HP Labs](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-labs/index.html) and I'm interested in solving problems related to real-time recommendation, time series analysis, and natural language processing. I use tools from information theory, statistical learning, and Bayesian modeling to tackle these challenges.

I hold a postgraduate degree from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) with a major in Data Science, and I also have a bachelor's degree in Statistics from [Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in/). Throughout my academic career, I have been fascinated by the data-centric approach to problem-solving, which has motivated me to explore this domain further.

My goal with this personal blog is to document my learnings on topics such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Statistical Learning, and share them with the world. I see this as a way to give back to the community
