Hey there, this is Ashish!

I’m a Data Scientist at [HP Labs](https://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-labs/index.html) interested in solving problems related to Real-Time recommendation, time series analysis and natural language processing using tools from information theory, statistical learning and Bayesian modelling.

I am a postgraduate from [Chennai Mathematical Institute](https://www.cmi.ac.in/) majoring in Data Science and also have a bachelor’s degree in Statistics from [Banaras Hindu University](https://www.bhu.ac.in/). Throughout my academic career, I was fascinated by the data-centric approach to solving problems which have led me to further explore the domain.

My goal with this personal blog is to document my learnings regarding Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Statistical Learning and in the process share it with the world. I consider this as a way of giving back to the community.
